#Python-Web-Scraper

# You will need to install Python 2.7.1

# you will need to pip install beautifulsoup4 and requests modules

#You will NOT be able to run this in a virtual environment

#instead you will need to have python added to your environmental path so you may run python webscrape.py

#to do so go to control panel, user, user accounts, change my environmental variables, and add cd C:\Python27 to your environmental path

#Then you will use pip install to install BOTH requests and beautifulsoup4 modules

#It should look something like pip install beautifulsoup4 or pip install requests

#Beyond that execute the program in python, by entering python webscrape.py into the command line

#Code derived from Nathan's Tutorial on youtube in using erquests and beautifulsoup4
